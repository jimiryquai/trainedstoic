## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Exercise Video Setup Guidelines

### Camera/Phone Positioning
- **Height**: Chest level for most exercises
- **Distance**: 6-8 feet back for full body shots
- **Angle**: Slightly off-center can be more dynamic than straight-on

### Lighting Placement for Exercise
```
    [Background Light]
           |
    [Fill Light]  YOU  [Key Light]
           |
      [Camera/Phone]
```

**Key Light**: 45¬∞ to your right or left, 6 feet away
**Fill Light**: Opposite side, dimmer, reduces shadows
**Background**: If using, behind you to separate from background

### Exercise-Specific Considerations

#### Full Body Movements (squats, lunges)
- Lights positioned higher (7-8 feet)
- Wider light spread
- Camera further back

#### Upper Body Focus (planks, push-ups)
- Lower light positioning
- Closer camera angle
- More focused lighting

#### Floor Exercises
- Overhead lighting important
- Consider additional floor-level fill light

## üí° Pro Tips

### Setup Tips
1. **Test Before Buying**: Use phone flashlight + white poster board to test positioning
2. **Start Simple**: One good key light is better than multiple bad lights
3. **Consider Your Space**: Measure your room before buying stands
4. **Power**: Ensure enough outlets or get battery-powered lights
5. **Color Temperature**: Match all lights (daylight 5600K recommended)

### Room Setup Requirements
- **Ceiling Height**: Need at least 8 feet for overhead lighting
- **Wall Color**: White or neutral walls reflect light better
- **Space**: Minimum 10x10 feet for full-body exercise videos
- **Flooring**: Consider how it looks on camera (yoga mats, etc.)

### Content Creation Tips
#### Lighting Setup
- Good lighting is crucial (soft, even lighting)
- Avoid shadows on the background
- Even lighting prevents AI artifacts

#### Camera Position
- Stable tripod
- Wide enough frame for full movements
- Consistent framing across videos

#### Clothing

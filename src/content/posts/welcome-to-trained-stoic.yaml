  # Welcome to Trained Stoic


  Welcome to **Trained Stoic**, where ancient wisdom meets modern resilience. In
  a world filled with constant change, uncertainty, and challenges, the
  philosophy of Stoicism offers timeless principles that can guide us toward a
  more fulfilling and resilient life.


  ## What is Stoicism?


  Stoicism is an ancient Greek philosophy founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in
  the early 3rd century BCE. At its core, Stoicism teaches us to focus on what
  we can control, accept what we cannot, and find peace in the distinction
  between the two.


  The philosophy emphasizes:


  - **Virtue as the highest good**: Living according to wisdom, justice,
  courage, and temperance

  - **Emotional resilience**: Not being overwhelmed by external circumstances

  - **Present-moment awareness**: Focusing on what we can do now, rather than
  worrying about the future or dwelling on the past

  - **Universal connection**: Understanding our place in the larger cosmos and
  our interconnectedness with all beings


  ## Why Stoicism Matters Today


  In our modern world, we face unique challenges that our ancestors couldn't
  have imagined. Social media, constant connectivity, information overload, and
  the pace of modern life can leave us feeling anxious, overwhelmed, and
  disconnected.


  Stoicism offers practical tools for navigating these challenges:


  ### 1. The Dichotomy of Control


  One of the most powerful Stoic concepts is understanding what is "up to us"
  and what is "not up to us." This principle helps us direct our energy toward
  what we can actually influence—our thoughts, actions, and responses—rather
  than wasting energy on external events beyond our control.


  ### 2. Emotional Regulation


  Stoicism teaches us that our emotions are largely determined by our judgments
  about events, not the events themselves. By examining and potentially changing
  our judgments, we can develop greater emotional stability and resilience.


  ### 3. Living According to Nature


  For Stoics, "living according to nature" means living according to our
  rational nature and our role as social beings. This involves developing
  wisdom, acting with justice, showing courage in the face of adversity, and
  practicing temperance in all things.

  a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking."
